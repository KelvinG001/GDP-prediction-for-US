# Project for predicting GDP

**All results are already shown in the jupyter notebook, so you do not need to rerun all the code.**

**If you want to rerun all the code, a yml file is prepared here to help you set up the working environment. Please note that rerun all the models in each jupyter notebook takes approximately 45 minutes.**

**In this model, some new features such as unemployment rate, inflation, and long term bond yied are also added. Young population and medium-age population, who play important roles in the money market and are the potential cause of secular stagnation, are also incorporated in the model**
